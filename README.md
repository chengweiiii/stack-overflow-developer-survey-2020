## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.* & Anaconda 3*

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nano-Degree. For this project, I am interested in using latest Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. Who are data scientist? Whats their profile?
2. What's the difference between data scientist and other developers
3. What tools (language, platform, database…) do data scientists use?

## Project Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The main notebook "stackoverflow_analytics.ipynb" provides a simple, easy and scalable way to explore and analyze structured questionaires like Stack Overflow Survey before really dig deeper into it. Ｗe can get the big picture of different groups and general feelings of data just by selecting interested column and run the plotting code.

## Results & Findings <a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the blog post available [here](https://medium.com/p/8158f145e393/edit).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The credit is given to Stack Overflow as they provide those valuable data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other information at the link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
