## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nano-Degree. For this project, I am interested in using latest Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. Who are the Data Scientist? What's the differences between data scientist and other developers?
2. How do we explore such amount of data? How can we get quick idea before really dig deeper?
3. Is there a fast and scalable way to explore and compare the difference?

## Project Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The main notebook "stackoverflow_analytics.ipynb" provides a simple, fast and scalable way to explore and analyze structured questionaires like Stack Overflow Survey before really dig deeper into it. ï¼·e can get the big picture of different groups and general "feelings" of data just by selecting interested column and run the code.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for their data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
